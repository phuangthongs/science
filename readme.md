This is a collection of Siri's simple simulations. Most of these are pretty easy to follow, and I hope that they will be helpful for you as you are dabbling into molecular simulation. While we extensively use C in our research group, I believe that Python may be easier for wider range of audience as it is more simplified and beginner friendly.

Please let me know if these are helpful! I will try to update this as often as I could :)
